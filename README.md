# Joe's Auto-Rice Bootstraping Scripts (JARBS)


## Installation:

On an Arch based distribution as root, run the following:

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ephjos/LARBS/master/larbs.sh
sh jarbs.sh
```

That's it.

## What is JARBS?

This is my version of [LARBS](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/LARBS),
